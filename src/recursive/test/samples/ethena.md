Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that will provide a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the 'Internet Bond'. Ethena's synthetic dollar, _USDe_, will provide the first censorship resistant, scalable and stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. _USDe_ will be fully backed transparently onchain and free to compose throughout DeFi. 
_USDe_ peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral alongside a mint and redeem arbitrage mechanism. 
The 'Internet Bond' will combine yield derived from staked Ethereum as well as the funding & basis spread from perpetual and futures' markets, to create the first onchain crypto-native 'bond' that can function as a dollar-denominated savings instrument for users in permitted jurisdictions.
